# DailyChatDownloader
Gui Version of DCD Terminal edition Note that some code is Closed Source because it uses discord rich presense.
This tool was made with dearpygui but I will be making a workflow to compile to linux and other systems because I've been having problems with making a build for ubuntu so it currently only works with windows. 

# Features
This users `dearpygui` which is a little eaiser to handle than `pyimgui` this also uses yyjson to convert some formats to Json.


## Discord Rich Presense

Let's others know your using DailyChatDownloader through discord (discord needs to be running and an account is required, you must be logged in) This is the only part that I made closed source using __pyarmor__...


## AFK mode

Allows you to do other things without having to worry about the computer shutting down during larger downloads. This is simillar to what some media-players like __VLC__ does but it uses __wakepy__ to keep systems awake.

I'll add more things as time goes on and details about them - Calloc
